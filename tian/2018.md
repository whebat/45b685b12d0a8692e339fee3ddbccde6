## Question 2: Pointers and Dynamic Memory

### (a)
In relation to C++ programming:

(i) What does pointer dereferencing mean?
<details><summary>Attempt</summary>

TODO
</details>
<details><summary>GPT</summary>
Pointer dereferencing in C++ means accessing the value stored in the memory location pointed to by a pointer variable. The dereference operator * is used to retrieve the value at the memory location pointed to by the pointer.
</details>

(ii) What is a memory leak and how can this be prevented?
<details><summary>Attempt</summary>

TODO
</details>
<details><summary>GPT</summary>
A memory leak in C++ occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not properly deallocated or released when it is no longer needed, leading to a loss of memory resources. Memory leaks can lead to a program using up all available memory, causing it to crash or slow down significantly.
To prevent memory leaks, it is important to ensure that any memory allocated using the new operator is properly deallocated using the delete operator when it is no longer needed.
</details>

(iii) What happens when the new operator is unable to provide the amount of memory requested?
<details><summary>Attempt</summary>

TODO
</details>
<details><summary>GPT</summary>
When the new operator is unable to provide the amount of memory requested, it throws an exception of type std::bad_alloc. This can occur if the system is low on memory or if the requested amount of memory is too large to be allocated.
</details>

(vi) What is a void pointer and what can it be used for?
<details><summary>Attempt</summary>

TODO
</details>
<details><summary>GPT</summary>
A void pointer in C++ is a pointer that can point to any data type, but does not have a specific data type associated with it. It is declared using the void * syntax. Since a void pointer does not have a specific data type, it cannot be dereferenced directly, but must first be cast to a pointer of a specific data type.
Void pointers are often used in generic programming or when dealing with memory management, as they allow for more flexible and dynamic memory allocation and manipulation. However, they should be used with caution, as they can lead to type mismatches and memory access errors if not used properly.
